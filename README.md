# Neural Networks and Deep Learning
This repository is a collection of resources that I used to dive into the field of neural networks and deep learning, and implementations of different kinds of neural networks in Python 3:
* from scratch
* using TensorFlow (without using inbuilt classes)

Most of the code is inspired from the online book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) by M. Nielson. Apart from this the following resources were used -
