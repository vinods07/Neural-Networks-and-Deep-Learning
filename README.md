# Neural Networks and Deep Learning
This repository is a collection of resources that I used to dive into the field of neural networks and deep learning, and implementations of different kinds of neural networks in Python 3:
* from scratch
* using TensorFlow (without using inbuilt classes)

## Code

* Feedforward neural network \[[scratch](NN.py) | [TensorFlow](tf_DNN.py)]
* vanilla Recurrent Neural Network \[[scratch](Recurrent_Neural_Networks/RNN.py) | [TensorFlow](Recurrent_Neural_Networks/tf_RNN.py)]
* MNIST handwritten digit classification \[[scratch](handwritten_digit_classifier.py) | [TensorFlow](tf_handwritten_digit_classifier.py)]
* Basic language modeling on PTB corpus using vanilla RNN \[[scratch](Recurrent_Neural_Networks/basic_language_modeling.py) | [TensorFlow](Recurrent_Neural_Networks/tf_basic_language_modeling.py)]

## Datasets and helper functions
* MNIST \[[dataset](data/MNIST/) | [helper code](mnist_loader.py)]
* PTB \[[dataset](data/PTB/) | [helper code](Recurrent_Neural_Networks/ptb_loader.py)]

## Resources
Most of the code is inspired from the online book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) by M. Nielson (pdf version of the same along with a chapter-wise summary can be found [here](Book/)). Apart from this, the following resources were used -
